.. py:class:: Crops


   A class to manage and calculate crop data within a specified catchment area.

   This class utilizes LUCAS (Land Use and Coverage Area frame Survey) data and
   cultivated land data to derive the area of different crops within a catchment.

   .. attribute:: api

      An instance of the CatchmentDataAPI for accessing catchment data.

      :type: CatchmentDataAPI

   .. py:method:: _derive_crops(catchment)

      Derives crop data for a specified catchment based on LUCAS data and cultivated land data.
      This method calculates the total area for each crop type within the catchment by utilizing
      the proportion of each crop type from LUCAS data and the total cultivated land area.

      :param catchment: The name of the catchment area.
      :type catchment: str

      :returns: A DataFrame containing the derived crop data for the catchment, including
                the catchment name, crop types, and their respective areas in hectares.
      :rtype: pandas.DataFrame


   .. py:method:: get_catchment_crops(catchment)

      Public method to retrieve the derived crop data for a specified catchment.
      This method serves as an interface to access the calculated crop areas
      and types within the catchment.

      :param catchment: The name of the catchment area.
      :type catchment: str

      :returns: A DataFrame containing the derived crop data for the specified catchment.
      :rtype: pandas.DataFrame
