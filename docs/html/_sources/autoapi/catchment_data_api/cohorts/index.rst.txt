.. py:class:: Cohorts(catchment_name)


   A class to manage and calculate livestock cohort populations within a specified catchment area.

   .. attribute:: api

      An instance of the CatchmentDataAPI to interact with catchment data.

      :type: CatchmentDataAPI

   .. attribute:: static_data

      An instance of StaticData to access static reference data.

      :type: StaticData

   .. attribute:: baseline_year

      The baseline year for the cohort data.

      :type: int

   .. attribute:: national_herd_raw

      Raw national herd data.

      :type: pandas.DataFrame

   .. attribute:: catchment_herd_raw

      Raw herd data for the specified catchment.

      :type: pandas.DataFrame

   .. attribute:: herd_relation_dict

      A dictionary defining relationships between different herd cohorts.

      :type: dict

   .. attribute:: cohorts

      A dictionary of cohorts with their populations.

      :type: dict

   .. attribute:: coef

      A dictionary of cohort coefficients used for population computations.

      :type: dict

   .. py:method:: get_cohorts()

      Produces a dictionary of cohorts, with their populations as values, based on the national herd data.

      :returns: A dictionary with cohort names as keys and their populations as values.
      :rtype: dict


   .. py:method:: compute_coef_cohort_population()

      Computes the coefficients for each cohort by dividing the individual cohort's population
      by the sum of the populations of related cohorts.

      :returns: A dictionary with cohort names as keys and their coefficients as values.
      :rtype: dict


   .. py:method:: compute_cohort_population_in_catchment()

      Computes the population of each cohort within the specified catchment area. This method
      calculates the population for both cattle and sheep cohorts based on the catchment's raw herd data
      and the computed cohort coefficients.

      :returns: A DataFrame containing the computed populations of each cohort for the specified catchment.
      :rtype: pandas.DataFrame
